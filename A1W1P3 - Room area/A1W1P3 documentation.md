## Code Snippet
```python
# Print what you need
print("Enter Width:")

# Request input and convert it to an int so we can use it in a formula
w = int(input())

# Print what you need
print("Enter Length:")

# Request input and convert it to an int so we can use it in a formula
h = int(input())

# Calculate area with the width and height input we just gathered
a = w*h

# Print the result - variable should be string since we concatenate it to a string 
print("The Area of the Room: " + str(a))
```
