## Assignment: A1W3P2 - Advanced palindrome

### Creation Date: 18-09-2023

### What did I learn?
Not applicable as the code I used is basically the same as the code I made for `A1W3P1 - Simple palindrome`.
The only difference is that the result print is expected to be different and I needed to add one extra `.replace()`. Specifically this replace `.replace(" ", "")` so it actually works with sentences.

### How did I learn it?
Not applicable

### Why/how did I solve it?
As Cigdem Okuyucu said this to me; I won't specify how I solved it or what my code is if I didn't
learn anything new in the assignment/problem.

## Code Snippet
```python
