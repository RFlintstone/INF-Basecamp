## Code Snippet
```python
# Print what you need for the input
print("Enter amount of years:")

# Request input and convert it to an int so we can use it in a formula
y = int(input())

# Use the input (y) to calculate months and days
m = y * 12
d = y * 365

# Print the results - variable should be string since we concatenate it to a string 
print("Years: " + str(y))
print("Months: " + str(m) + ",")
print("Days: " + str(d))
```
