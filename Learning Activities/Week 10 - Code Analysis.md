## Code Analysis

There is a code provided below by a programmer. Looking to the initializer of the class, it seems the code starts by reading data from a file. Unfortunately, we don't have access to the file, but we can analyze the code and understand how the content of the file is structured.

- Read the body of load_data(self). Try to guess how the data columns are structured.

It will read each line from the file and split them as new items in a list.
Then it from each list item it will get the temperature data by mapping it.

- Reading the method `load_data(self)` we may understand the structure of the data columns and data types, but still we don't know the meaning of data values. This is something we can extract from the method `construct_temprature_list(self)`. Read this method carefully and try to explain what will be result of this method?

It will return a result like this [(2022, {1: 32.5, 2: 28.0}), (2023, {3: 25.1, 4: 27.8})]
because of 
```py
temperature_list.append((year, {}))
```
and 
```py
if month not in temperature_list[-1][1]:
                temperature_list[-1][1][month] = 0.0
            temperature_list[-1][1][month] = max(temperature , temperature_list[-1][1][month])
```

- Manually write some lines within a text file and try to run the code using your own data values. Does it print what you expect?

Yes, `12 19 2023 0` prints what I expected to be printed, namely `[(2023, {12: 0.0, 15: 0.0})]`

```py
class TemperatureDataAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, file_path):
        self.file_path = file_path
        self.temperature_data = []
        
    # Method to open the file and load lines as an attribute
    def load_data(self):
        with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
            data = [line.strip().split() for line in file]
            self.temperature_data = [list(map(int,d[:-1]))+[float(d[len(d)-1])] for d in data]
            
    # Method to perform the analysis and construct the list
    def construct_temperature_list(self):
        temperature_list = []
        for data in self.temperature_data:
            month, day, year, temperature = data[:]
            if year not in [item[0] for item in temperature_list]:
                temperature_list.append((year, {}))
            if month not in temperature_list[-1][1]:
                temperature_list[-1][1][month] = 0.0
            temperature_list[-1][1][month] = max(temperature , temperature_list[-1][1][month])
        return temperature_list

def main():
    file_path = './temps.txt'  
    analyzer = TemperatureDataAnalyzer(file_path)
    analyzer.load_data()
    temperature_list = analyzer.construct_temperature_list()
    print(temperature_list)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
