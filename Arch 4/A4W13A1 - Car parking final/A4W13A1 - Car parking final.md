## Assignment: A4W13A1 - Car parking final

### Creation Date: 11-14-2023

### What did I learn?
I learned that you need to commit your changed with sqllite3 otherwhise it won't properly update the database.

### How did I learn it?
Mostly through trial and error and a bit of research.

### Why/how did I solve it?
With the car parking assessment I created a 'quick-test.py' file, so I could easily check if the code what was being run by codegrade was passing in the IDE. If it was then I pretty much knew Codegrade would accept it as well. (Although there were instances where the behaviour was different)

## Code Snippet
```python

```
