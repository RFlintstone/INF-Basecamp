## Assignment: A1W1P1

### Creation Date: 04-09-2023

### What did I learn?
I learned nothing with this assignment.

### How did I learn it?
Not applicable

### Why/how did I solve it?
The input method defaults to strings, so I concatenated the input which I have called name, to "Hello" in the print method to successfully pass the assignment.

## Code Snippet
```python
# Print what we need
print("What's your name?")

# Request input
name = input()

# Print input - no conversion needed for the variable as it's already a string
print("Hello " + name)
```
