## Code Snippet
```python
# Print what we need
print("Enter amount of years:")

# Request input and convert it to an int so we can use it in a formula
y = int(input())

# Use input to calculate both months and days
m = y * 12
d = y * 365

# Print the result - variable should be string since we concatenate it to a string 
print("Months: " + str(m))
print(", Days: " + str(d))
```
