## Assignment: A2W6A1 - Addressbook

### Creation Date: 10-10-2023

### What did I learn?
I learned that you can use dict.extend() to merge multiple dictionaries.

### How did I learn it?
I looked up how I could merge multiple dictionaries cause I knew it must be possible with a build in method.

### Why/how did I solve it?
As Cigdem Okuyucu said this to me; I won't specify how I solved it or what my code is if I didn't
learn anything new in the assignment/problem.

## Code Snippet
```python
# Merge emails and phone numbers
merged_contact['emails'].extend(contact['emails'])
merged_contact['phone_numbers'].extend(contact['phone_numbers'])
```
