### What did I learn?
Nothing

### How did I learn it?
Not applicable

### Why/how did I solve it?
I requested user input, casted it to int and then did modulo (%) with 2 to see if the remainder is uneven. 
If it is the result is uneven, if not the result is always even.  

## Code Snippet
```python
# Ask for input and immediately make it an int
i = int(input())

# Modulo to check if the input is even or odd as it will check the remainder
if i % 2:
    print("Odd")
else:
    print("Even")
```
